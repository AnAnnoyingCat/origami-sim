### Origami Simulation with Collision and Friction (TODO: Find better title)

This is a physics based Origami simulation aimed at simulating the behaviour of actuated creases including approximating friction and other physical forces

# Different types of creases

<ul>
 <li><b>B</b>: Border creases. These make up the border of the origami. </li>
 <li><b>M/V</b>: Mountain and Valley folds. These are your normal kinds of folds. </li>
 <li><b>U</b>: Undriven creases. These may swing and fold freely. </li>
 <li><b>F</b>: Facet creases. These are used in triangulation. They are very stiff and try to stay flat. </li>

</ul>
